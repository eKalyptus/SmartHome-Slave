# SmartHome-Slave
Scripts for the Arduino Slaves that are Communicating with the Base Raspberry Pi via the Serial Port.

##Requirements
- Arduino
- 433mHz Transmitter
- Base Raspberry Pi with Script Running ([?](https://github.com/k0a1adev/SmartHome-Base))
- USB Cable to connect the Arduino and Raspberry Pi
- The [RCSwitch](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch) Library
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

##Wiring
- 433Mhz Transmitter (Pin \#10) 

##Usage
Just load the Script onto your Arduino of choice, disconnect it and connect it to the Raspberry Pi with the USB Cable. You are ready to go!

##Future Plans
- Adding new Sensors (Temperature Sensor, Light Sensor, Motion Sensor)
- Adding Relais
